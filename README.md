# stone-paper-scissors-javaScript-project
This JavaScript code creates a Stone-Paper-Scissors game. The user selects an option, the computer picks randomly, and results are shown (win, lose, or draw). It tracks scores, highlights computer choices, and resets with "New Game". A mode button switches between light and dark themes for the interface.
